# TRAVERSING THROUGH THE ABYSS

Hai! ABYSSRUSH is the first project of my new game dev career. It's a game involving a legendary group of adventurers and a hellish dimension. In order to escape said realm, the crew must reunite by following the zeroes of guidance and seal the gateway they opened. 

It's a pretty awesome game, I hope you'll check it out on https://maymay39.itch.io/abyssrush. What's it about?

# ABOUT ABYSSRUSH

Shoot through 5 chapters with unique new enemies, shooting techniques, and characters. Each area uses 4 colors from the Color Graphics Adapter palette by IBM in celebration of it's 40th anniversary. The first 5 chapters have 49 stages and 1 boss stage each, while the last one - It's a bit of a doozy, I wouldn't want to spoil it.

The controls are easy to use but hard to master, and enemies can be difficult to dodge. There is little to no luck required, only skill. While each character controls the same way, their movement speed, rotation speed, and shooting weapon differ each chapter to provide an interesting experience.

So how about it? If you haven't played it before, now's the time. You can get sprites and such from this repository for fan content, just credit my development studio Dino's Cove if you use them. The Music is by Chris Chudly and Chris Mann, so please credit them instead of us if you use their music as they do not work with Dino's Cove and are not affiliated with us in any way. Thanks for reading this, and have a good day!
